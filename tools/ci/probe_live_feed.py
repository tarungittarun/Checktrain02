"""Ask the live-feed endpoints what they actually answer, and report it on the commit.

Why this runs in CI: it is a network question, and the answer differs per egress path. Measured, not
assumed: this sandbox gets `TLS/SSL connection has been closed` from `enquiry.indianrail.gov.in`, and so did
GitHub-hosted runners (the probe comments posted on da0633c and b41c38c) — which is why the script's real
output is a *reachability verdict*, and why the device stays the only witness for what the feed actually
sends. Runners do vary by region and by egress pool, so asking costs seconds and an answer is worth having
in writing; when every path is blocked, that is a finding, and the app must then not promise live data.

The second half of that sentence is why `erail.in` is probed here too: it is a plain GET, keyless, and its
own header carries the feed stamp, so if any CI path can reach anything, it is probably that one.

The app's own request shape is defined by `NtesWire.kt`; this script mirrors it with the same static key,
IV and signature secret, because that is the only way to find out whether the Kotlin implementation would
have worked before a user does. It reports structure, not contents: which keys exist, which of the
stop-level fields carry real times, how many rows have an actual arrival. A train that is 5-10 minutes
late is included on purpose — a feed that only answers "On Time" is exactly the failure the user called
out.

Stdlib + `pycryptodome` (installed by the job; if it is absent the script says so and exits 0, because a
probe that cannot run must not be able to fail the build it is helping).
