"""Turn the per-row status files of the e2e matrix into one verdict, and decide whether it is acceptable.

Lives in a file rather than inline in the workflow for a reason that has already bitten this project: a
`python3 - << PY` heredoc inside a YAML block scalar carries the YAML indentation with it, and Python reads
that as one unexpected indent at line 1. The failure looks like a broken pipeline, not a broken string, and
it is invisible until somebody runs the job.

The verdict rule is the part worth reading: a row whose emulator never booted is *reported*, not failed,
because a free GitHub runner has no /dev/kvm and that is infrastructure, not product. But if **no** row
booted, the whole run fails, because a device-test pipeline that silently tested no device is worse than
no device pipeline at all — it is a green light with nothing behind it.
