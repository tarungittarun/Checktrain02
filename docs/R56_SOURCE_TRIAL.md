# R56 · low-connectivity source trial (13–14 Oct 2026)

## What was measured on the owner's cellular connection

Train 16227, origin run 13 Oct, selected MYS→TLGP. These are diagnostic-log measurements, **not** claims that another source is equivalent to NTES:

| Candidate | Observed result | Safe role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct official NTES encrypted POST | 00:04:49, 61285 bytes in ~0.5 s; 29 dated stops and actual times. Repeat at 00:06:53 in 0.58 s, 00:14:13 in 0.47 s, 00:15:01 in 0.66 s. | First live witness. Route + past stop actuals; never promote future ETA/ETD. |
| erail live list | Identified 16227 MYS→TLGP and endpoints; 00:04:44 list stamp dated 12 Oct. | Train identity/search, **not** confirmed actual stops. |
| erail status/route page | 704 text bytes after 8.15 s; halt list did not align to full 29-stop NTES route. | Do not ask after NTES succeeds; no actuals. |
| runningstatus.in | 5,341 text bytes after ~11 s, no validated dated per-stop result in this run. | Candidate independent witness on NTES failure, not a replacement for official actuals. |
| confirmtkt | No independently corroborated same-run per-stop actuals in supplied capture. | Only cross-check dated, plausible actuals; no promotion of forecasts. |
| ixigo / crowd reports | No verified stop minutes in this capture (crowd read 0 reports). | Unverified probe / opt-in traveller report. |

## Other apps / research (not a claim of compatible APIs)

- [Where is my Train's Play description](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whereismytrain.android) says its **on-board** offline tracking uses cell towers and cached route information, without internet or GPS. That requires a measured tower-to-railway map and users on the train. There is no demonstrated public, permitted Where is my Train per-stop API or tower database for this project. Its excellent on-board mode is **not** evidence that scraping an app endpoint will supply dependable actual times. Do not represent our schedule interpolation as equivalent.
- [RailYatri's explanation](https://www.railyatri.in/live-train-status) describes phone GPS/cell-tower crowd location; it is a potential *on-board* fallback, not proof of downloadable per-stop actuals. Opt-in GPS here already exists and must remain explicitly labelled `DERIVED · GPS` rather than NTES actuals.
- [RailRadar API documentation](https://railradar.in/docs) lists train live/route endpoints but also an API access/keys section. A reachable TLS handshake in the diary is not an authenticated successful same-run per-stop response; don't silently add a key-dependent provider to a keyless app.
- `tarungittarun/kilotrain` ADR-0012 implements official NTES and explicitly did not capture per-stop actuals; its statement that another app uses NTES is an unverified assumption. The owner's earlier 3–4 s source might be different; this evidence does not identify it.

## Design chosen

Keep the measured subsecond official direct POST first. Do not spend ~8–11 s of concurrent cellular bandwidth on page probes when it has answered. Persist *only* a successful, run-bound official route **with** its observed stop snapshot, in private app storage keyed by train and origin day. Paint it immediately during a tunnel, label it last-known with the original stamp and age, keep position unknown beyond its last observation, never carry its delay into an unseen future stop. Retry the official request in the background; on failure, let independent sources try, keeping their evidence and provenance separate. The 29 official halts already include the observed intermediate stops; no pass-through station gets an invented minute. No proprietary app scraping, unproven host, purchased key, or fabricated cell-tower position ships.

## Further candidate validation before adding any new live feed

For one train and **origin run**, collect a bounded response on a real cellular device and in a tunnel: response code/bytes/latency, train and run identity, station codes in sequence, schedule vs actual vs forecast columns, source update stamp, whether future rows echo the schedule, and the site's published API/access policy. Test one known intermediate halt and midnight rollover. Only then add a provider that can actually return verified past minutes; do not promote a reachable TLS socket or marketing claim to a sixth working feed.
