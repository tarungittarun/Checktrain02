# ADR-006: crowdsensed per-stop actuals (the WIMT path)

Status: PROPOSED — needs the owner's word (the brief reserved this decision; the owner's "implement
how other apps do it" message is the trigger for writing it down properly).

## Context (all measured, not assumed, 2026-10-12)

- NTES closes on **CI runners and on the owner's own phone**, every transport (diag logs 09:50/10:13 IST).
- erail's live-status endpoint **403s every header identity** from CI (runs 548a5db→a339ab6); its tile
  endpoint has **never carried per-stop times** (v1, LiveProvider).
- railradar is **401 keyless**; its key is paid.
- The last untested door (erail's endpoint from erail's own WebView engine) is wired into the shipping
  probe as of today and may still close.
- Where Is My Train (100M+ installs, Google) started by scraping NTES, but its engine is
  **crowdsourcing**: travellers' phones on trains contribute GPS/cell-tower context — "a Google Traffic
  equivalent for trains" (founder interview, theindianotes 2025-08; Wikipedia). Reddit consensus says
  the same: WIMT "uses data given by users".

## Proposal

Travellers who ARE on a train opt in to a **reporter mode**: one bounded report per halt — station
context + coarse GPS + observed departure/arrival, anonymous, no account. Waiting travellers read the
same stream for their train. Relay: a **public, keyless, account-less pub/sub** (ntfy.sh-class service)
— not our server, not keyed, not an account; named in the provenance line as a third-party dependency
and degraded honestly when it is unreachable.

Honesty guards (non-negotiable): reports render as "reported by travellers (N witnesses, last 10 min)",
never as official data; plausibility-checked against the timetable (a report claiming 90 min early is
displayed as suspect or dropped); the screen always keeps the timetable column beside the reported one.

## Consequences

+ The only remaining path that does not depend on a server the railways can blanket-block: the witnesses
  are already past every firewall — they are ON the train.
+ Zero infrastructure of ours; zero keys; zero accounts.
− A third-party relay dependency (labelled, and the screen must say "reports unavailable" when it is down).
− Cold-start: useless until reports exist (WIMT took two years; we will be honest that this is a
  network-effects feature).
− Abuse: liars exist; multi-witness weighting + plausibility bounds keep one liar from owning a screen.
− Privacy: coarse location, opt-in, anonymous, only while reporting is on; stated in plain words on the toggle.

## Decision requested from the owner

(a) **Approve**: implement reporter mode + keyless relay + traveller-report column next.
(b) **Decline**: the app keeps the honest dash and the measured sentences forever.
