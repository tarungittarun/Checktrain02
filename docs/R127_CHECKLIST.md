# R127 · logo/Home and tracking polish — 18 Oct 2026

This is a change checklist, not a claim of live railway correctness. Keep PR #3 open until the owner's phone check. The downloadable `latest-apk` URL must not be called R127 until the current-head build publishes it.

- [x] **Home logo with populated results:** do not re-select the already-active station mode (which cleared the ViewModel report but left old RecyclerView rows). Keep the source/count summary, heading, sort, and same-mode result; reopen the search card at wrap-content height and reset list scroll to top. A new render fixture has **three populated rows** and checks geometry; a device journey searches a station pair, taps the logo and checks the retained result/summary and bounded gap.
- [x] Tracking top-left now shows the locomotive logo and **TrackTrain**, still returning to the list; Settings, Settings Back and Refresh are 48dp icon targets with content descriptions. Refresh is blue and rotates while a manual/Auto request runs; rotation stops on completion or screen exit.
- [x] The website-supported intermediate marker reads **At [station]** and **As on [HH:mm]**; this is its *last reported event*, not a GPS or inferred current position. Leave NTES actuals and website claims distinct.
- [x] Remove **About time** button. The source picker gets its full row width; long-press it for the existing time explanation and technical **Source details**. Give the long-press action a TalkBack description.
- [x] Render manual and Auto response durations (both in the receipt and source picker) to **one decimal second**, without inventing seconds on a minute-resolution source-update time. Both use the existing selected-source-first refresh chain.
- [x] Only **NTES** and **Where Is My Train · website (unverified)** appear in the Settings and tracking source selectors. Nonselected diagnostic/fallback implementations remain internal; the website and WIMT web cache are **not** phone-app telemetry. Do not rename a probe as verified phone-app data.
- [x] Shorten the distance-based gap between halt rows about 25%, and shorten mapped-intermediate spacing slightly, with a 76dp minimum when a site-reported marker needs both text and age. Put the provenance badge above long source warnings at large font sizes. Bump section labels from 10sp to 11sp and fixed route headings from 11sp to 12sp medium, and turn off animated list item replacement to avoid jumps during live updates.
- [x] Version and diagnostic stamp updated together: versionCode **57**, versionName **1.0.56-r127**, stamp **R127**.
- [x] Static resource/reference/member/lexical, E2E selector and flow-inventory checks passed locally. **Pending:** current-head Android compile/render/unit checks, updated-APK full E2E, measured row counts/wall times, SHA-256 and APK delivery. Static checks do not prove layout on a phone or live parity.

## Verification log (fill from the updated APK, not R126)

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Android build + render/unit tests | `39104479937` PASS: 391 JVM cases, 38 rendered-screen cases, six published-APK traveller partitions. Follow-up density fixes and pixel-painted ACTUAL heading assertion require replacement. Earlier builds: `39103040010` failed four geometry checks; `39103507120` failed only a 1-pixel JPEG export. |
| Current-head full E2E device rows | `39104479984`: 23/25 matrix partitions + six published-APK acceptance partitions passed = 29/31. Density station2 failed the populated-Home result exposure; density track3 failed provenance visibility below the source warning. Search-card cap and badge order corrected for replacement. Earlier `39103507165` had three obsolete Settings assertion failures (22/25). |
| Strict APK correspondence and per-job wall audit | `4911889`: strict FAIL, independently built E2E DEX mismatch/unverified, 33/55 jobs/workflows >180s/unmeasured; 890s E2E wall (<15 min). Recheck unchanged strict audit on replacement. |
| APK byte count, SHA-256 and version | `4911889` published: 11,124,076 bytes, SHA-256 `65935b92842eed63bd7067d12e48a42ac43725bd90fe2d4a3147ca42cf687037`, versionCode 57. Replacement identity pending. |
| On-phone live data parity | Not verified by an emulator |
