/**
 * A request sent with the browser engine's network stack, with the answer read back as **bytes**.
 *
 * Why the app has one at all: on the phone this project is developed against, `HttpURLConnection` opens the
 * socket to the railway enquiry endpoint in ~100 ms and then has every TLS handshake hung up on -
 * `IOException: closed`, across eleven request shapes and both TLS profiles - while Chrome on the same phone,
 * same Wi-Fi, same minute loads the same site. The difference is the client: the browser's fingerprint, ALPN
 * set and header order are examined at the far end, and this app's platform stack does not survive that. Using
 * the engine that is already installed costs no key, no proxy of ours, and no sign-up.
 *
 * Why it is no longer a *renderer*. The previous version of this file asked the engine to `loadUrl`/`postUrl`
 * the API directly and read `document.body.innerText` back. That is what produced the line that made me
 * believe the endpoint "answered 159 bytes" from a phone in Bengaluru. Those 159 bytes were:
 *
 *     This page contains the following errors: error on line 1 at column 1: Start tag expected, '<' not found
 *     Below is a rendering of the page up to the fir
 *
 * - Android's own message for "the server sent me something that is not markup". The response body never
 * reached us: a JSON answer cannot be rendered, so the parser error *became* the document, truncated at
 * column 1, exactly as the wording promises. A GET of the same API through the same renderer returned 506
 * bytes of the NTES HTML page for the same reason: the site answers a mis-called endpoint with its own page.
 * Two consequences, both acted on here: an answer read this way can never be parsed into live data, and it
 * must never be reported as if it had been.
 *
 * So the request now rides *inside* a page. The engine loads a same-origin document - any of them, including
 * the site's own 404 - and from that document this code runs `fetch()` on the API and reads the returned text
 * out of a JavaScript global. Same origin, so the site's cookies and its `Referer` are there; a real
 * `Response` object, so the HTTP status and `Content-Type` are known for the first time; and no parser in the
 * middle, so the bytes are the server's, not the renderer's. It is, in other words, the request the NTES
 * website makes for itself - which is the one request shape this app has never been able to produce, because
 * it needs an origin.
 *
 * What this is NOT: a browser, a web view in the UI, or a way for a page to reach into the app.
 *
 *  - The view is never attached to a window and never shown; the traveller sees the same screens as before.
 *  - There is no `addJavascriptInterface`, so no document - not even a hostile one served in place of the
 *    API - can call into this process. The only script run here is the three-line `fetch` above, and the only
 *    thing read back is one global this code names.
 *  - File, content, database and cache access are off; nothing is persisted by us. The engine's own cookie jar
 *    stays in the app's data directory, which is what makes a session cookie possible, and it is cleared by the
 *    same button in Settings that clears the live cache.
 *  - Only railway endpoints are ever loaded: [originPage] derives the ride-along page from the API URL itself.
 *
 * Threading: `WebView` insists on the main looper, so the work is posted there and awaited on the caller's (an
 * IO) thread. The main thread is never blocked - the latch is on the other side - and a call that outlives its
 * budget tears the engine down, so one stalled page cannot poison the next refresh.
