/**
 * Everything the tracking screen prints, computed once, in one place.
 *
 * This type exists because of a specific bug. The header was phrased by the position engine while the
 * stop list decided each row's state with its own `seq < anchorSeq` comparison, and the two disagreed:
 * the screen said "departed TIPTUR" and showed Tiptur's own row as *not* departed. Two rules over the
 * same facts will drift like that, and the user reads whichever they look at first. So the header is
 * now derived from the rows below, and the rows are the only place a state is computed.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin, no Android: the invariant that matters ("the highlighted row is the row the headline
 * talks about") is asserted in a plain unit test.
