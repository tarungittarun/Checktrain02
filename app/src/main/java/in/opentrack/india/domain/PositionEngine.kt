/**
 * Derives "where is the train" from "what did the network last confirm".
 *
 * The Indian Railways feeds usable for free report **events**, not a GPS trace: *at BRC, departed
 * 12:22, 14 min late*. Turning that into a moving marker needs an explicit model, and the model *is*
 * the product — a marker that jumps, rewinds, or sits at a station for two hours after departure
 * destroys trust faster than no marker at all. Rules, in priority order:
 *
 *  1. **A confirmed event wins.** The position is pinned to the stop until enough elapsed time on
 *     the next leg makes interpolation meaningful. That hysteresis is what stops the marker
 *     flickering between "at BRC" and "between BRC and RTM" on every refresh.
 *  2. **Between stations, interpolate on time, not distance.** The feed gives the delay at the anchor,
 *     so the honest estimate is `elapsed / (scheduledLegMin + delay)`; when the leg duration is
 *     unknown we report the anchor rather than guessing.
 *  3. **Never move backwards** ([RailTimePosition.held]). Re-broadcast of an older event (routine on
 *     relayed feeds) must not drag the marker 200 km back.
 *  4. **A measurement outranks a relay.** If the device is on the train and GPS places it more than
 *     [GPS_AHEAD_SEGMENTS] segment(s) ahead of the interpolated point, follow the device and label it
 *     `DERIVED · GPS`. GPS is never required.
 *  5. **Staleness is visible.** Beyond [STALE_MS] the snapshot is history: still drawn (that is what
 *     offline-first is for) but the provenance changes so the UI can dim it.
 *  6. **No invented precision.** An ETA is produced only when the feed supplied one or the remaining
 *     leg is short; otherwise [TrainPosition.etaNextMinute] is null and the UI must say "between A
 *     and B".
