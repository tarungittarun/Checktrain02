/**
 * TTL cache for live pair listings, keyed by station pair.
 *
 * A cache read is NEVER live (brief 7.5): everything that comes out of here carries the [Entry]'s
 * fetched-at time, and the caller renders it with the cached-age wording, not "via <source>". The clock
 * is injected because a cache that checks freshness against the wall clock cannot be tested - the same
 * reason freshness compares against a feed stamp, not System.now.
 *
 * Pure JVM, fixed capacity (a passenger visits a handful of pairs; 16 is generous), no eviction
 * cleverness: oldest-fetched out.
