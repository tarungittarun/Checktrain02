/**
 * Renders a screen the way a device would, on the JVM, and writes the result out as an image.
 *
 * There is no emulator available for this project (no KVM, no system images) and no way to look at the app
 * from CI, which left the one thing a reviewer can judge only by looking completely unverified. Robolectric
 * runs the real framework: the actual layout XML is inflated against the actual theme, measured, laid out
 * and painted by the same drawing code a phone runs.
 *
 * `prepare` deliberately runs *between two* measure passes. The custom views here compute geometry from
 * their own `width` when they are handed data (`TrackInsightView.setJourney`), so binding before the first
 * layout would paint into a zero-size canvas — an artefact of the harness, not of the app.
