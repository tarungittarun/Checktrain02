/**
 * The device-side request experiment, tested on the parts that are pure.
 *
 * The variants themselves need a network, so what is pinned here is the reasoning the probe depends on: that
 * every variant is a different question rather than a restatement, that a shape adopted for one train is
 * rebuilt for the next one instead of replayed, and that the report stays silent until something has actually
 * been measured. A diagnostic that lies by omission ("probe: nothing to report") while the network is down is
 * how a support conversation ends up chasing a request shape that was never wrong.
